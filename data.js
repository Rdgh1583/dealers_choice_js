      "The Fujifilm X-T4 ($1,699.95, body only) is getting a lot of buzz from enthusiast and pro photographers alike, and with good reason: It's the first X-T camera to feature in-body image stabilization (IBIS). In addition to that headline feature, it offers improved battery life, autofocus, continuous shooting performance, and handling versus the previous-generation X-T3. It's a class-leading product, and the best smaller-than-full-frame sensor camera you can get. In addition to earning our Editors' Choice award, it's also worthy of a full five-star rating.",
